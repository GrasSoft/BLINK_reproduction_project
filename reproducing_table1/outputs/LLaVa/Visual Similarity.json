Stained Glass Windows: These windows seem to have different patterns, which may suggest that they are unique to each image.\n\n3. Decorative Ceiling: The ceiling features similar decorations and colors in the first and third images, but the second image has a slightly different pattern or color palette.\n\n4. Exterior Elements: The exterior elements such as the sky background and the architectural details seem consistent across all three images.\n\nBased on these observations, I would conclude that the first image is most similar to the third image in terms of the building's material, decorative ceiling, and exterior elements like the sky.

The third image also includes the same red classic car, but this time, it is positioned at an angle that obscures more of the vehicle compared to the first and second images.\n\nComparing these two images with the reference image, the second image has a closer match to the reference photo due to the similar orientation of the cars and the overall composition that includes other classic cars in the background.
